> Important: Please make sure to commit often and make the messages as descriptive as possible. If the work is returned to us with only one commit, we will not be able to evaluate the work.

## Getting started

### Install dependencies: `yarn`

### Start project: `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Edit App.js

The entry point for the app is App.js. You can edit this file to get started. You can also add new files to the src folder and import them in App.js.

## Task

Create a project card based on the design provided. The card should match the design as closely as possible. It is *not* required that the product card be functional. The point of the task is to see how you approach the problem from a design implementation perspective. This means clicking the swatches, aborbency buttons or image does not need to do anything. However, please use semantic HTML elements where it makes sense, for example a button instead of an image even though the button does not do anything.

### Design

The design can be found in the `design` folder under the name Product-Card-Design.jpeg. The product image is located in the public folder, and the Droplet SVG is located in the `src` folder.

## Completing

When you are done, please zip up and send the project back to us. Please do not include the `node_modules` folder in the zip file. You can also upload the project to a public repository on GitHub and send us the link. Please make sure to commit often and make sure the messages are as descriptive as possible.
